This repo is a temp setup until I properly configure symlinks/chezmoi etc.

## Instructions
`setup-0` pulls in the relevant customization files (e.g. `.zshrc`) and folders (`~/.config/nvim/`) on my personal machine.

Then I can run the following scripts to mimic my dev environment on another machine:
1. `setup-1`: Basic setup: git, python, vim, tmux, ohmyzsh, node, tldr, p10k (manual config) 
2. `setup-2`: Remaining setup: zsh customization, neovim

Follow instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/m9bpbw/how_to_install_nerdfonts_in_wsl/) to install the desired nerd font. 

This was a useful [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVcC5ifbXL8&list=PLx2ksyallYzW4WNYHD9xOFrPRYGlntAft&index=8) to setup LSP in Neovim.
